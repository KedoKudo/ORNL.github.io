# Aims and Scope

<p align="justify">
High-performance computing (HPC) is at an inflection point in which the near-end of Moore’s Law, the big data explosion from AI workflows and next generation scientific instruments, the increasing operational costs beyond exascale, and the extreme heterogeneity of hardware vendors architecture and software systems have led to significant technical and economical barriers. Thus accessing cutting-edge HPC effectively has become a significant complex investment and endeavor with little reminiscence of the pre-accelerator and many-core era before the last decade.
<br /> 
<br /> 
The first “Democratizing HPC” (D-HPC) half-day workshop aligns with the “I am HPC” overarching goal of Supercomputing 2023 (SC23). D-HPC invites interdisciplinary communities of developers, facilities, vendors, users, researchers, educators, etc., to define, understand and quantify accessibility of current and future HPC technologies and ecosystems characterizing the path from idea to scientific discovery. Past examples of high-impact technologies that enabled HPC democratization are the message passing interface (MPI) and graphics processing units (GPU) providing accessible communication and processing power. We understand the technical democratization of HPC in its broadest meaning, pursuing success stories about enabling and/or improving accessibility in data- and compute-intensive applications across all domains ranging from traditional areas like simulations, data management and analysis, to more recent fields, such as AI, for a wide variety of extreme heterogeneity computing targets such as: manycore, quantum, neuromorphic, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), chiplets, etc.
</p>


# Call for Papers
<p align="justify">
D-HPC invites submissions of full technical papers for inclusion in the SC23 workshops proceedings.
To meet our scientific goals, we require that the presented conclusions are based on rigorous analysis of empirical data, rather than anecdotal. This implies quantifying the accessibility in experiences and use-cases with a strong focus on novel or practical solutions, challenges and impact of their before/after scenarios.
</p>

**Topics of interest**, but are not limited to :
- The impact of programming languages and models, compiler techniques, libraries, domain-specific languages (DSLs), communication, data frameworks and ecosystems in improving access to HPC applications
- Making the convergence of HPC + AI more accessible
- HPC accessibility to big data experiments
- Accessible exascale and post-Moore heterogeneous hardware: quantum computing hardware, new architectures: many-core, accelerators, GPUs, file systems, neuromorphic systems, FPGA, chiplets, etc.
- AI techniques to improve HPC accessibility (e.g. generative AI tools such as OpenAI API or Codex based on GTP-3, machine and deep learning models).
- Multidisciplinary end-to-end co-design practices, processes, paradigms that provide accessible HPC: e.g. fault tolerance designs, data reduction, porting to new architectures, proxy applications
- Virtualization techniques that provide performance portable cross-system access
- Proposed metrics and the theoretical framework for studies quantifying accessibility in future procurement systems based on existing empirical data
- Standards and ecosystem sustainability requirements for accessible future systems

**Examples of metrics** used for HPC accessibility are, but not limited to:
- Scalable performance improvements from providing HPC access to new problems and communities
- The number of core-hours, user or developer time, failure rates, time to overall solution, energy metrics as a result of leveraging accessibility
- The economics, benefits and impact of porting existing code to new architectures
- Technology adoption rates and communities impacted due to accessibility improvements

**Out of Scope:**
- Papers describing the technical merits of a particular technology or methodology without showing metrics that illustrate their impact on making HPC more accessible
- Position or review papers and papers highlighting the community or educational aspects only
- Papers describing merits on advancing a specific scientific application domain rather than HPC access 
- Papers that do not describe targeted HPC systems or communities benefiting from improved accessibility

**Paper Format:** 
This year SC is implementing a workshop proceedings. Papers must abide with the SC23 reproducibility initiative and provide an artifact description. The best paper award will be selected by the technical committee based on impact, relevance and quality of the work.
More details to come..
<!-- Paper must be submitted via the SC23 linklings website.
Full paper should be 10 pages using the IEEE conference proceedings format. This limit includes tables, figures, references, but not reproducibility appendix. -->

**Best Paper Award:**
The best paper award will be selected by the technical committee based on impact, relevance and quality of the work.
