<p align="justify">
<a href="https://julialang.org">Julia</a> is a modern open-source language and unified ecosystem for science. Powered by the widely vendor-adopted <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM compiler infrastructure</a>, Julia attempts to close the gaps in high-productivity and high-performance, in which the combination of Python with traditional compiled languages C, C++ and Fortran, <b>Python+X</b>, can be a costly development and maintenance investment for scientific projects.

Julia's out-of-the-box abstraction for multidimensional arrays and math, while providing a powerful high-level interface for data analysis, visualization and interactive computing (the Julia REPL, Jupyter and Pluto.jl notebooks). In addition, several aspects that traditionally belong to a language ecosystem are core aspects of Julia: packaging, reproducible environments, and powerful macros metaprogramming for code instrumentation (profiling, testing, etc.) and interoperability with existing Fortran, C and Python codes. Thus, Julia provides an interesting investment when trying to find a balance between development costs and scientific discovery.
</p>

# Aims and Scope

<p align="justify">
After a successful <a href="https://ornl.github.io/events/jufos2022/">first edition in 2022</a> with 101 registration, lightning talks and discussion sessions, the Second Julia for ORNL Science Workshop, JuFOS 2024, invites the lab's scientific community to share current challenges and opportunities for their computing needs. We aim to provide a venue to discuss the potential of Julia as a language for science, and its ecosystem, current, uses and community status updates.

Our goal is to provide a venue to exchange research and development ideas about current state-of-the-art development of scientific codes at ORNL and potential collaborations and investments around a relatively new language designed for science. We welcome applications from the wide range of experimental, observational, high-performance computing (HPC) projects at ORNL.
</p>

# Call for Lightning Talks

We invite ORNL participants to present a 3 to 5 minute lightning talk that aligns with the scope of the workshop (option provided in the registration form).


**Topics:**

- Experiences using Julia in experimental, observational science
- Experiences using Julia in heterogeneous HPC (CPU, GPU, network, I/O, etc.)
- Existing co-design challenges in C, C++, Fortran, Python: packaging, performance, composition, programming models
- Status and roadmap of languages for scientific computing
- Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning (AI/ML) workflows
- Experiences with high-level languages (Python, R, Julia) in HPC
- Ecosystems for Reproducibility and Performance Portability
- Community codes written in Julia
- Julia as a language for teaching computational science concepts
- Interactive data analysis and visualization (Jupyter, Pluto.jl)
- Julia for research software engineering
- High-level languages for rapid prototyping

# Registration

<p align="justify">
While this is a hybrid event, we encourage in-person participation for the morning, working lunch, lightning talks and panel sessions to learn more about the language and its community. We invite attendees to share their work regarding with the lab community by submitting a 3-5 minute lightning talk.
Lunch, snacks and coffee will be provided for in-person attendees. Virtual attendees will receive a Zoom link to join the event.
</p>

**Registration Link:** Please register by **June 1st 2024** [here](https://forms.gle/5izuP7EWy9pQgL9X7). 

> The registration form includes the option to propose a lightning talk.

- **Registration is required for in-person and virtual meeting option via Zoom**
- **We encourage early registration for in-person participation due to the venue's limited capacity**

# Virtual Tutorial Events

These virtual events are offered the week of the workshop. Separate registration is required, please visit these events [site](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/2024/05/02/julia-for-hpc-and-intro-to-julia-for-science/).
Registration for the workshop DOES NOT include registration for the virtual tutorials.

- **Julia for HPC:** Tuesday, June 18th 2024, 1:00pm-4:00pm
- **Intro to Julia for Science:** Friday, June 19th 2024, 1:00pm-4:00pm
