<p align="justify">
Generative AI are revolutionary technologies with profound impacts on our daily human-computing interactions, facilitating the creation of content that emulates human creativity. Among these, Large language models (LLM), such as OpenAIâ€™s Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) foundation models and Google's Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), have become a significant focus in the current landscape. Beyond understanding their impact and limitations, there is a crucial need to ensure their correctness, verify their outputs, and promote safe usage, especially in the context of the DOE's scientific mission. It is imperative that these models are responsibly used and their broader implications are thoroughly examined to effectively serve in scientific research and exploration.
</p>

# Aims and Scope

<p align="justify">
The Generative AI for ORNL Science Workshop series, invites the scientific community to share current challenges, requirements and opportunities for the safe use of generative AI technologies in our mission. 
Our goal is to provide a venue to educate and exchange research and development ideas, collaborations and investments around the current state-of-the-art in these relatively new technologies. We welcome lightning talk proposals from the wide range of experimental, observational, high-performance computing (HPC) projects at ORNL.  
We will summarize our ideas, findings and key opportunities in a subsequent report that we will share with the community and interested participants.
</p>


# Registration

<p align="justify">
While this is a hybrid event, we encourage in-person participation to improve interactions with the speakers and within the community.
</p>

**Registration Link:** Please register by **July 13, 2023** (CLOSED). 

> External (virtual or in-person) participants need to register. If you are attending SMC23 (https://smc.ornl.gov), you are automatically approved to attend but you still need to register with a special registration link.
> ORNL (virtual or in-person) participants need to register with an internal registration link provided by the workshop organizers. 

> Note: Registration is open until July 13 for external and non-SMC23 attendees. 

> The registration form includes the option to propose a talk focusing on the requirements for scientific areas that are representative.

- **Registration is required for in-person or virtual participation via Zoom**
- **We encourage early registration for in-person participation due to the venue's limited capacity**

# Call for Talks

We invite participants to present a talk that aligns with the scope of the workshop (option provided in the registration form)
Full talks (45mins) and lightning talks (2-3mins) are encouraged.

**Topics:**

- Requirements and conditions for applying Generative AI in scientific contexts
- Implementing safeguards and verification methods for generative AI models to ensure safety and correctness
- Exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs): delving into models such as GPT, Bard, and more
- Ensuring safe usage of generative AI in observational, experimental, and computational science: the balance between innovation and corretness
- Assessing the transformative impact of LLMs on the scientific discovery process: the advantages, potential limitations, and broader implications
