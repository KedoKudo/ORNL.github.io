<p align="justify">
Generative AI using large language models (LLM), in particular OpenAIâ€™s generative Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) foundation models and Google's Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), are revolutionary technologies impacting our daily human-computing interactions. LLMs have become a ubiquitous topic in the present era and there is a strong need to understand their impact, limitations, and broader implications for Oak Ridge National Laboratory's (ORNL) scientific mission.
</p>

# Aims and Scope

<p align="justify">
The LLM for ORNL Science Workshop, LLMFOS invites the scientific community to share current challenges, requirements and opportunities for the ethical use of LLM technologies in our mission. 
The goal is to provide a venue to exchange research and development ideas about current state-of-the-art LLMs and potential collaborations and investments around a relatively new technology. We welcome applications from the wide range of experimental, observational, high-performance computing (HPC) projects at ORNL.  
We will summarize our ideas, findings and key opportunities in a subsequent report that we will share with the community and interested participants.
</p>


# Registration

<p align="justify">
While this is a hybrid event, we encourage in-person participation for the tutorial, working lunch session, lightning talks, panel and birds-of-a-feather (BoF) discussion to learn more about LLMs and build a community at ORNL.
</p>

**Registration Link:** Please register by **July 07th**. 

> Registration is still open for virtual participation until July 15th, in-person registration is closed

> The registration form includes the option to propose a lightning talk focusing of requirements for scientific areas that are representative of ORNL.

- **Registration is required for in-person and virtual meeting option via Zoom**
- **We encourage early registration for in-person participation due to the venue's limited capacity (closed)**

# Call for Lightning Talks

We invite ORNL participants to present a 3 to 5 minute lightning talk that aligns with the scope of the workshop (option provided in the registration form).


**Topics:**

- Application requirements for LLMs
- Impact of LLMs in the scientific discovery process
- Responsible use of LLMs for science
