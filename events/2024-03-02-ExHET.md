<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
While computing technologies have remained relatively stable for nearly two decades, new architectural features, such as specialized hardware, 
heterogeneous cores, deep memory hierarchies, and near-memory processing, have emerged as possible solutions to address the concerns of energy-efficiency, 
manufacturability, and cost. However, we expect this ‘golden age’ of architectural change to lead to extreme heterogeneity and it will have a major impact 
on software systems and applications. In this upcoming exascale and extreme heterogeneity era, it will be critical to explore new software approaches that 
will enable us to effectively exploit this diverse hardware to advance science, the next-generation systems with heterogeneous elements will need to 
accommodate complex workflows. This is mainly due to the many forms of heterogeneous accelerators (no longer just GPU accelerators) in this heterogeneous 
era, and the need of mapping different parts of an application onto elements most appropriate for that application component. 
</p>

<h2><strong>Keynote (Nick Brown, University of Edinburgh):</strong></h2> <strong>Domain-specific abstractions: A panacea or false promise for programming extreme heterogeneous architectures</strong>
<font color="#FFFFFF"><img src="./images/nick_brown.jpg" alt="Dr. Nick Brown" border="1" align="right" class="right"/></font>
<p>
	There is a saying that it's called hardware because developing it is hard. However,
	in recent years there has been a Cambrian explosion in novel hardware architectures that one
	can use to undertake their calculations and the major blocker is now in fact on the software
	side. HPC developers must be able to effectively exploit such a diverse mix of hardware
	without significant architecture-specific expertise and extensively modifying their code for
	each technology. This is something that we are currently unable to provide but it is critical
	that we solve the issue, not least because such a heterogeneous mix can often deliver very
	significant energy advantages. In this talk, I will discuss our efforts to leverage knowledge of
	the programmer's intentions via domain-specific abstractions during compilation using
	MLIR. In our approach, computational patterns are identified and then drive the compilation
	process which enables a single, unmodified, source code to target a wide variety of
	architectures including GPUs, FPGAs, CGRAs, and the CS-2. By building upon the MLIR
	infrastructure we are able to often deliver a step change in performance and productivity
	compared to the current state of the art.
</p>
<p>
	Dr Nick Brown is a Senior Research Fellow at EPCC, University of Edinburgh
	with research interests in novel hardware architectures and how we empower HPC developers
	to leverage these most effectively without extensive architecture-specific knowledge. Much
	of his research has focussed on developing algorithmic techniques to enable the optimization
	of HPC codes on architectures such as FPGAs and RISC-V, and he runs testbeds as part of
	the ExCALIBUR exascale program which provides access to these for developers to
	experiment with their workloads on. He is also the knowledge exchange coordinator for the
	xDSL project which aims to develop a common DSL compiler ecosystem based on LLVM
	and MLIR. He has developed numerous production HPC simulation codes in the past,
	including the Met Office's high-resolution atmospheric model called MONC.
