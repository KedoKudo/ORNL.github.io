# About

The ORNL AI Seminar Series (Biweekly/Hybrid), organized by the [AI Initiative](https://www.ornl.gov/ai-initiative), serves as a platform for researchers and engineers from diverse scientific, engineering, and national security backgrounds spanning ORNL, universities, and industry.
Our main objective is to encourage collaboration with the goal of driving transformative advancements in safe, trustworthy, and energy-efficient AI research and its applications.

The seminar will be held every other Thursday from 10 am to 11 am ET.
Please reach out to the organizers if you would like to recommend a spearker or give a talk.

**Accelerating Astronomical Discovery: Synergies Between Generative AI, Large Language Models, and Data-Driven Astronomy**

<br>Room: Weinberg Auditorium (4500N/I-126)
<br>Time: 10-11 am ET, Thursday, 03/25/2024
<br>Microsoft Teams link: TBA
<br>[Dr. Yuan-Sen Ting](https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~yting/)

**Abstract**

The era of data-driven astronomy presents researchers with an unprecedented volume of data, comprising billions of images and tens of millions of spectra.
This abundance of information prompts critical questions about expediting astrophysical discoveries, uncovering previously undetected celestial phenomena, and deciphering the intricate physics governing the Universe.
In this presentation, we explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and astronomy, aiming to bridge existing gaps by harnessing the synergies between these domains.
We highlight the transformative potential of generative AI in tackling complex, non-linear inference problems that have traditionally been considered intractable, offering an alternative to conventional Bayesian inference methods.
Moreover, we introduce our work, AstroLLaMA, on developing a Large Language Model (LLM) specifically tailored for astronomical research.
This initiative leverages cutting-edge advancements in LLM technology to facilitate hypothesis generation and accelerate discoveries, laying the foundation for the realization of a fully integrated AI Astronomer.

**Bio**

Yuan-Sen is an Associate Professor in astronomy and computer science at the Australian National University and an Associate Professor in astronomy at the Ohio State University. Yuan-Sen's research applies machine learning to advance statistical inferences using large astronomical survey data. A Malaysian native, Yuan-Sen received his PhD in astronomy and astrophysics from Harvard University in 2017. After graduating, Yuan Sen was awarded a unique four-way joint postdoctoral fellowship from Princeton University, Carnegie Institute for Sciences, NASA Hubble and the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton before reallocating to Australia. Yuan-Sen also serves as the co-chair of the NASA Cosmic Programs Stars Science Interest Group and leads future spectroscopic surveys as the science group leader. He is an author of more than 185 publications, many of them on topics at the frontier of astrophysics and machine learning.
