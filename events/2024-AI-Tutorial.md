# ORNL AI Initiative: Secure, Trustworthy, and Energy-Efficient AI for Science Tutorial Series

ORNL [AI Initiative](https://www.ornl.gov/ai-initiative)’s tutorial series is designed to equip the scientific community with cutting-edge methodologies, technologies developed within ORNL and specifically through the AI initiative.

Each half-day tutorial is structured to cover a broad spectrum of **AI for science** applications, from graph neural networks in materials modeling to machine learning in hyperspectral image reconstruction.

The tutorials are designed for researchers of all levels who seek to deepen their understanding of AI for Science.
Our primary audience includes researchers with a foundation in AI, aiming to explore and implement advanced, trustworthy AI techniques within scientific contexts.
Additionally, we invite researchers and practitioners from the industry, as well as graduate, postgraduate, and undergraduate students from universities who are engaged in AI research and aspire to acquire knowledge specifically in AI for science.
Although we will touch upon fundamental concepts in AI for science, our curriculum does not encompass introductory AI topics.

The tutorials will place a strong emphasis on open-source principles and non-sensitive topics and content.
We will share open-source code, provide detailed code walkthroughs, and offer hands-on exercises to enhance learning and engagement.

The tutorials will be held **virtually**, allowing participants to join virtually.
Microsoft Teams link will be announced.

Registration is not required for ORNL participants.
For non-ORNL participants, an entry pass is required even for virtual attendance.
For non-US citizens, this process may take up to **45** days.
Please email Jessica Woods at woodsjb@ornl.gov **and** Taylor Bullock at bullocktm@ornl.gov. 
Include a short bio and explain why you wish to attend the tutorial series.
Note that the tutorials will be recorded and made available online after 2-3 weeks.
Therefore, please request an entry pass only if you need to attend virtually.

**Abstract**

During the tutorial, we will show how to use HydraGNN (https://github.com/ORNL/HydraGNN), our scalable implementation of multi-task learning graph neural networks developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory #ORNL as part of the ORNL Artificial Intelligence Initiative.
After discussing scientific motivations behind the need to develop scalable GNN training to support scientific applications of interest to the US Department of Energy (DOE), we will cover a hands-on session with examples of increasing difficulty. In particular, we will show how HydraGNN can be used to scale the training of GNN models on millions of atomic structures on OLCF-Summit, NERSC-Perlmutter, and OLCF-Frontier. To this day, we achieved linear scaling on these DOE leadership class supercomputing facilities using up to 1,024 GPUs.

**Bio**

Massimiliano (Max) Lupo Pasini obtained his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Mathematical Engineering at the Politecnico di Milano in Milan, Italy. The focus of his undergraduate and master studies was statistics and discretization techniques and reduction order models for partial differential equations. He obtained his PhD in Applied Mathematics at Emory University in Atlanta (GA) in May 2018. The main topic of his doctorate work was the development of efficient and resilient linear solvers for upcoming computing architectures moving towards exascale. Upon graduation, Max joined the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) as a Postdoctoral Researcher Associate in the Scientific Computing Group at the National Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS).

In November 2019, Max became a computational scientist in the Scalable Algorithms and Coupled Physics Group in the Advanced Computing Methods for Engineered Systems Section of the Computational Sciences and Engineering Division at ORNL. In November 2020, Max became a data scientist in the Computational Coupled Physics group within the same section.

Max’s research focuses on the development of surrogate and generative AI models for material sciences, scalable hyper parameter optimization techniques for deep learning (DL) models, and acceleration of computational methods for physics applications. He was the technical lead of the Surrogates Models for Material Properties product within the Artificial Intelligence for Science and Discovery (AISD) thrust of the ORNL Artificial Intelligence Initiative in the fiscal years FY21, FY22, and FY23. He is currently the interim technical lead of the AISD thrust for fiscal years FY24 and FY25.
