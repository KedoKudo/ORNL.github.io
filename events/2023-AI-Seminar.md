**Abstract:** 
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their capability to automate complex tasks effectively across various domains. Yet, LLMs face inherent limitations: a knowledge cutoff leading to outdated information, a lack of deep contextual understanding, and challenges with advanced problem-solving. These issues are especially critical in scientific research where up-to-date information, thorough understanding, and complex problem-solving are essential. This presentation examines how agent-based methods address these challenges in chemistry and explores their potential in automating other areas of scientific research.

**Bio:** 
Samantha Cox is a 2nd year PhD student at the University of Rochester studying chemical engineering. Under the advisement of Dr. Andrew White, her research focuses on developing computational tools for addressing chemistry and chemical engineering problems. She completed her BS in Chemistry from Lee University in 2021 and has recently joined technical
staff at an AI + Bio institute. Samantha's work encompasses symmetric molecular dynamics and the integration of AI and large language models with chemistry.
