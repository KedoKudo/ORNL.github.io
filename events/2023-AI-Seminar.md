# About

<p align="justify">
The ORNL AI Seminar Series (Biweekly/Hybrid), organized by the <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/ai-initiative"> AI Initiative</a>, serves as a platform for researchers and engineers from diverse scientific, engineering, and national security backgrounds spanning ORNL, universities, and industry. Our main objective is to encourage collaboration with the goal of driving transformative advancements in safe, trustworthy, and energy-efficient AI research and its applications. The seminar will be held every other Thursday from 10 am to 11 am ET. 
  
The seminar will be held every other Thursday from 10–11 am ET. Please reach out to the organizers if you would like to give a talk.

**Abstract:** 
Machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly being deployed in or considered for safety and/or security-critical settings. Unfortunately, most extant ML systems contain serious vulnerabilities that may cause them to fail in the presence of an adversary or simply novel, off-distribution inputs. Currently, identifying these vulnerabilities typically requires careful testing by skilled practitioners, a labor-intensive and expensive process. In this presentation, we describe several methods for automated testing: using ML systems to test other ML systems. In particular, we will describe an approach using RL to identify [issues with agents acting in simulated robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10615), and a recent finding showing [serious vulnerabilities in supposedly "superhuman" Go AI systems](https://goattack.far.ai/).

**Bio:** 
Adam Gleave is the CEO and co-founder of FAR AI, a trustworthy AI research non-profit working to incubate and accelerate new safety research agendas. Adam’s research focuses on adversarial robustness and value learning for open-ended reinforcement learning agents and language models. Adam received his PhD from UC Berkeley under the supervision of Stuart Russell and funded by an Open Philanthropy Fellowship. Adam has previously worked at DeepMind and several quantitative trading firms.
