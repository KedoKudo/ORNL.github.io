**Abstract:** 
This talk will present a scientific machine learning method that learns from data a computationally inexpensive surrogate model for a time-dependent nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE), an enabling technology for many computational algorithms used in engineering settings. The method brings together two main elements. First, ideas from projection-based model reduction are used to explicitly parametrize the learned model by low-dimensional polynomial operators which reflect the known form of the governing PDE. Second, supervised machine learning tools are used to infer from data the reduced operators of this physics-informed parametrization. For systems whose governing PDEs contain more general (non-polynomial) nonlinearities, the learned model performance can be improved through the use of lifting variable transformations which expose polynomial structure in the PDE. Numerical experiments on a three-dimensional rocket combustion simulation with over 18 million degrees of freedom demonstrate that the learned reduced models achieve accurate predictions with a dimension reduction of five orders of magnitude and model runtime reduction of up to nine orders of magnitude.

**Bio:** 
Elizabeth Qian holds a joint appointment at Georgia Tech as Assistant Professor in the Schools of Aerospace Engineering and Computational Science and Engineering. Her interdisciplinary research develops new computational methods to enable engineering design and decision-making for complex systems. Her specialties are in developing efficient surrogate models through model reduction and scientific machine learning, and in developing multifidelity approaches to accelerate expensive computations in uncertainty quantification, optimization, and control.

Elizabeth previously held a postdoctoral appointment as von Karman Instructor at Caltech in the Department of Computing + Mathematical Sciences. She earned her PhD, SM, and SB degrees from the MIT Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics. Highlights of her awards and honors include a Caltech-wide teaching award from the undergraduate student body, the 2020 SIAM Student Paper Prize, the Fannie and John Hertz Foundation Fellowship, and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. She is also an alumna of the U.S. Fulbright student program.
